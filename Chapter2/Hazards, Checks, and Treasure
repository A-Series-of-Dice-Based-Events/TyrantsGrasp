This seems like a complicated system to convert.  Further research will have to be done.  It may just require an upping of complexity, kp and its thresholds.

Sophia (She/Her)Today at 1:33 PM
I dont think you need to change too much tbh
 
Sophia (She/Her)Today at 1:33 PM
just change the DCs to be appropriate, and use skill proficiency to determine the base dice size, potentially with a class based dice modifier on top of it
if I remember how research works correctly
 
Rko-RamblerToday at 1:35 PM
I'll give that a shot.  Thank you Sophia.
 
Sophia (She/Her)Today at 1:38 PM
ignore the old by 5 system and dont require a confirmation for a critical success
my suggestion is to use trained as a 1d4+mod, expert as 1d6, master as 1d8 and legendary as 1d10
if they're using an appropriate lore or use magic of the same tradition, +1dice size.

Creatures
Notes:  Creating Ju Ju Zombies from your player’s first level sheets.  Doing this may have to wait until you have your player’s sheets but using the gm hazard and creature creation doc I am giving a few suggestions below.  Info is given in a (high, medium, low) format.  Of course if any of these statistics were higher for your characters at level 1 then use that value.

Alignment: NE
Traits:  Add Undead Zombie
Perception: +12, +9, +6
Ability Scores: +4, +3, +1 (Increase str and dex by one level here.  If it is already high use +6)
Skills: Add (Acrobatics (h), Athletics (m)); +10, +9, +6
Armor Class: 19, 18, 16
Saves: +12, +9, +6 
HP: 46, 40, 34 (These values may seem low if you look at the creation docs but they are modified by the Immunities and Resistances)
Immunities: Cold, Electricity, Magic Missiles
Resistances Fire 5, All physical 5 (except Slashing)
Weakness physical (magic) 5
Strikes: +12, +10, +8 (The zombie gains a slam strike that is in line with these statistics 
Melee slam (agile, finesse) +?, 1d8+5 bludgeoning
Special Abilities:  Remember that these zombies will have all of your 1st level PC’s special abilities (ex: Shield Block etc.)
Spells:  For any spellcasting character I would use a DC 20 +12, and for non focused characters I would use 17, +9.  Use this rule for special abilities as well.
These zombies should have all of the pc’s first level equipment that they have scavenged from RC.

(Changed our boy here to an undead bloodline sorcerer because witch isn’t finished yet and it was a lot of work I didn’t want to do.  With his abilities to use the juju zombies more I think this is an effective build.  Also note that I gave him a flatcap greater hat of the magi which will allow him to summon an elemental (i suggest earth) if the juju zombies go down too quickly.  Some notes about tactics include using his harm ability to both heal his juju zombies and give himself temp hp.  Remember that 5th level harm can be drawn out into a 3 action to heal all undead targets within range.  As he is a dhampir this includes him. Grasping grave to slow down enemies.)
