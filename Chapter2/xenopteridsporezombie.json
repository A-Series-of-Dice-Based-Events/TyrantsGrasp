Effect The xenopterid sinks its mandibles into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim’s Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the xenopterid regains HP equal to 10 percent of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that’s already drained doesn’t restore any HP to the xenopterid but increases the victim’s drain value by 1.   A victim’s drained condition decreases by 1 per day. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes."}],"alignment":"ne","size":"medium","type":"animal","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"35 ft., climb 15 ft., fly 15 ft.","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","strength":{"value":"7","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"6","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"4","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"6","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":"17","benchmark":"moderate","note":"darkvision, lifesense 60 ft.
